            <p class="about-subtitle">A platform built to connect care, records, and communities.</p>
            <p>At Companima, we believe that every animal deserves thoughtful care, clear records, and a safe
               connection
               between the people who look after them. Whether it’s a beloved family pet, a rescued animal waiting
               for a
               new
               home, or livestock managed on a farm, keeping track of health and wellbeing should be simple,
               transparent,
               and
               reliable.
            </p>
            <p>
               Companima was created to bridge the gap between animal owners, veterinarians, farms, and adoption
               networks.
               Our
               platform brings essential information into one place, from medical histories and vaccination records
               to
               appointments, notes, and identification details. This allows owners to stay informed, veterinarians to
               work
               efficiently, and caregivers to make better decisions based on accurate data.
            </p>
            <p>
               For pet owners, Companima offers peace of mind. You can easily follow your animal’s health journey,
               share
               records with your vet, and stay up to date with upcoming treatments or check-ups. For veterinary
               professionals,
               the platform supports structured workflows, clear documentation, and better communication with
               clients.
               For
               farms and shelters, Companima helps manage animals at scale while maintaining individual health
               records
               and
               compliance.
            </p>
            <p>
               Beyond management and tracking, Companima is also about connection, connecting animals with care,
               professionals with the tools they need, and communities with responsible adoption opportunities. Our
               goal
               is
               to
               support better outcomes for animals by making collaboration easier and information accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
               Companima is built with flexibility and growth in mind, designed to adapt to different needs while
               keeping
               animal welfare at its core. As the platform evolves, our focus remains the same: helping animals live
               healthier
               lives through better coordination, care, and trust.</p>
